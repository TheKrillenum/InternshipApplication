Welcome to my C++/UE5 repository !

My name is MatÃ©o Costille, and you will find here 3 project that showcase my skills in C++ and in UE5.
Each project shows a different aspect of my skillset:

Battleship 		-> It is entirely done in C++ with VisualStudio2022, and is playable through the console only. 
MultiplayerMap_UE5 	-> It is a demo of a map that I created for a "Quake"-like game, made entirely in blueprints.
Battlezone 		-> This project is a multiplayer project that mix both UE5's blueprints and some C++.

All of those project can be open from their folders, and all code/blueprint are available there. 
However if you simply want to try out the games/demo, you can launch all of them from the "Launchers" folder.



EXTRA:
UML diagrams for the Battleship project can be found in it's folder.
Feature documents for the "Quake"-like game can be found in it's folder as well.
